# MLB Pitch Tunneling Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
Pitch tunneling is something the average viewer does not see when watching a baseball game. However, those who play the sport know just how much of a difference it can make. First, let's define a "tunnel." A tunnel is the path that a pitch appears to be taking as it is headed to the plate. Hitters have a very short window in which they must decide whether or not to swing at a pitch. When you throw two pitches that appear to come out of the same tunnel, that is what is called tunneling. The longer a pitch stays in the tunnel, the harder it is for a hitter to decide whether or not to swing at a pitch. Certain pitches tunnel better than others. My goal was to build a dashboard to be able to explore the effectiveness of different pitch sequences and how long they stay in the same tunnel.

## Tools used
For this project, I used pandas for constructing dataframes, numpy for mathematical operations, plotly for visualizations, and Streamlit for dashboard construction.

## Where I got my data and how I used it
I got my data from the Python library pybaseball. It is a library that pulls data from Statcast and Fangraphs, which both contain loads of useful data. In order to achieve my goal, I needed some creativity to figure out how to measure the effectiveness of how two pitches tunnel. From my research, a batter must decide whether or not to swing when the pitch is roughly 25-30 feet from home plate. However, when I asked Gemini, it said the decision-making point was at 23.8 feet. I decided to go with 23.8, as it is closer to the plate, so it will really show whether the pitches cluster in a certain area or not for each pitcher. Now, Statcast does not have data on the location of a pitch at that point. What they do have is data on the release position, velocity, and acceleration for each of the 3 axes. With this, we can use some physics to find the position of the pitches at 23.8 feet from the plate. 

## Dashboard Construction
To illustrate the full picture, I wanted to show results for any pitcher desired by the user of this dashboard. I started by giving options to select a pitcher to analyze and the season in which to do so. The program will then fetch the pitch-by-pitch data for that pitcher from the given season. Once that loads, it will give you options to select two different pitches and how they tunnel. The graphs shown display the pitches and their position at the decision-making point, and when they cross the plate. There are graphs from both the catcher's view and the pitcher's view, as some may have different preferences. It's important to note that the pitches shown in these graphs are only pitches that are thrown sequentially. For example, if you select Four Seam Fastball and Slider, the graph will only display instances in which a fastball and slider were thrown directly after each other in that order. The reason for this is to show what hitters are faced with and the decisions that have to be made in real time. As a baseball player myself, I would want to see how a pitcher follows up the previous pitch. If I were looking to see what pitches a pitcher could tunnel effectively, I would not add this constraint. But, most top pitchers in the MLB have a gameplan and they stick to it. It's what got them to the top. I also added metrics to show how much distance separated the pitches when they were at the point of decision-making and how far they were at the plate. The last thing you will see on this dashboard is a "deception ratio", which is the distance at the tunnel divided by the distance at the plate to show how much greater the difference is between those two locations.

## Results
The results were quite fascinating. When looking at different pitchers and their sequences, you can see how they find success at such a high level. One example of a pitcher I found very intriguing was Chris Sale. He is known for his nasty slider. I wanted to see how well it followed up his fastball. The results explained everything.

As you can see, the pitches are very closely clustered together. 

Another pitcher I looked at was Logan Gilbert. He was a pitcher who saw a lot of success this season. He throws a variety of pitches, but what I was interested in was his fastball and splitter sequencing. With a lot of pitchers that throw a good changeup or splitter, you are told to see it down. I wanted to see if that really helps at all.

Here, you can see that his splitter does appear a bit lower than his fastball at the tunnel. Now, this isn't to say that looking for this at the plate will make a huge difference, as he throws many different pitches. However, if you take a deeper dive, his fastball is the pitch he uses the most to set up his splitter. His slider is the only other pitch he throws consistently before his splitter. So, if you are a hitter who struggled with the splitter in an earlier at-bat, and you just took a fastball, now it may be helpful to try to see it down.

## Challenges
A majority of the challenges I faced came with loading the data efficiently. In order to do so, I did not have the dashboard load any data in upon its start. The downside of this is that you need to enter a pitcher's name with perfect spelling, or you will receive an error. To handle any issues with the scale of my requests, I broke up the requests to only request data from a month at a time. For some reason, I still couldn't get it to load. I turned to Gemini to ask why, and it turns out that running the dashboard on local host was my problem. The last cell in my notebook was written by Gemini to connect to Cloudflare to run the dashboard instead. Knowing that my problem was as simple as that, I may make some improvements in the future that require a few more data requests.
